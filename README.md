Hey there! 👋 I'm Oma, and I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions to complex problems. As a DevOps engineer with experience in Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services like Azure and AWS, I love tackling technical challenges and finding creative ways to optimize deployment efficiency and reliability.

In my most recent role, I deployed a Kubernetes app to a production environment, cutting deployment time by 2 hours while highlighting possible failure points and their mitigation. I also developed optimized deployment guides for developers, resulting in a 30% reduction in errors during deployment, and refactored codebases to increase successful deployments by 20%.

Additionally, I've collaborated with teams to develop APIs for e-commerce solutions and trading applications, implemented robust CI/CD pipelines, and documented the importance of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) in engineering for business leaders.

I'm always excited to learn and grow, and I'm eager to tackle new challenges and make an impact in the tech industry.
